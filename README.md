OpenBench strives to be the home for open, high quality ADME-Tox datasets and the gathering place for _in silico_ ADME-Tox discussion online. This repository is meant to host tools, datasets, and research, including supporting materials for the [OpenBench Weekly](https://opnbnch.substack.com/welcome) newsletter.
